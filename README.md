This project provides a ready-to-use starter pack that combines [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) in a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. It aims to serve as a solid foundation for all your future projects.

Laravel provides a clean and elegant syntax for back-end development, while Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces for front-end development. By integrating these two technologies, you get a supercharged full-stack web application development experience.

## Features

- Laravel 9.x, a robust and easy-to-use PHP framework for server-side
- Svelte 3.x, a JavaScript framework for building fast and efficient user interfaces
- SPA Architecture
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS
- Authentication using Laravel Sanctum
- Docker support for easy development and deployment

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a recent version of PHP (8.1 or later), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.
